<!-- API-EVANGELIST-PROVENANCE:BEGIN -->
> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **Not from the company, and here with a question?** You are welcome here — we would rather be the
> front line and point you the right way than have a good report go nowhere. What this repository
> can answer is narrow, though, so it is worth knowing who you are actually looking for:
>
> - **A question about how the API works, an account, billing, or a bug in the service** — that is
>   the company's own support, not us. We profile this API; we do not operate it and cannot see
>   your account.
> - **A bug in an open-source project we only catalog** — file it on that project's own repository.
>   This has happened with a real and correct bug report that reached us instead of the people who
>   could fix it, which helped nobody.
> - **Anything about this listing itself** — the description, the tags, the rating, a missing or
>   wrong artifact — is ours. Open an issue here.
> - **Not sure, or something general about API Evangelist or APIs.io** — open an issue on the
>   [APIs.io Inbox](https://github.com/api-search/inbox) and we will route it.
>
> **This repository contains no software, and we will never ask you to download anything.** There is
> no build, release, installer, or binary here — only text and machine-readable API descriptions, so
> there is nothing here that can be "corrupt" or need "repairing". Any issue, comment, or email
> claiming otherwise and offering a download link is not from us and is hostile. Do not follow the
> link; it is a lure. Report it to GitHub and, if you like, tell us at
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) so we can take it down.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is a public research university in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, a member of the Association of American Universities and the flagship of the University of North Carolina System. It operates no central developer portal, no API gateway and publishes no OpenAPI of its own, but it does run several genuinely institution-engineered machine-readable surfaces — most notably the Carolina Digital Repository services API and its IIIF 3.0 endpoints, served by box-c, a repository application UNC Libraries writes and maintains in the open. The rest of the footprint is tenant relationships on vendor platforms, and those contracts are not credited to UNC.

## APIs

Every surface carries an `x-operator` in `apis.yml`: **institution** means UNC runs the thing the
contract describes, **tenant** means UNC's data on a vendor's contract. Only the institution rows
are UNC's own engineering.

**Institution-operated**

- **Carolina Digital Repository Services API (box-c)** — Keyless JSON search over 2.1M records plus IIIF Presentation 3.0 manifests and IIIF Image 3.0 info. Base: https://dcr.lib.unc.edu/services/api | Source: https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/box-c
- **UNC Libraries Catalog Search API** — TRLN Discovery / Blacklight JSON. Base: https://catalog.lib.unc.edu/catalog.json
- **UNC Finding Aids Search API** — Blacklight JSON:API over Wilson Special Collections finding aids. Base: https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/catalog.json
- **UNC Dataverse OAI-PMH Archive** — OAI-PMH 2.0, advertising oai_dc, oai_ddi, dataverse_json, Datacite and oai_datacite. Base: https://dataverse.unc.edu/oai
- **UNC Shibboleth Identity Provider** — SAML 2.0 metadata; InCommon entity `urn:mace:incommon:unc.edu`. Base: https://sso.unc.edu/idp
- **Facilities SPOTS REST API** — Institution-operated but entirely Onyen-gated; no contract detail is publicly readable. Docs: https://facilities.unc.edu/resources/mapping-and-space/spots-rest-api/

**Tenant relationships (vendor contract, UNC's data)**

- **UNC Dataverse Native REST API** — Dataverse 6.8's contract, shipped by eight institutions in this catalog. Base: https://dataverse.unc.edu/api
- **UNC Catalog Course Search API** — Leepfrog CourseLeaf (`catalog.unc.edu` CNAME `unc-public.courseleaf.com`). Base: https://catalog.unc.edu/course-search/api/
- **UNC GIS Open Data Hub** — Esri ArcGIS Hub, DCAT-US 1.1 feed. Base: https://gisdata-uncadmin.opendata.arcgis.com/api/feed/dcat-us/1.1.json
- **UNC Digital Collections Search** — OCLC CONTENTdm 6.10 on a UNC host. Site: https://dc.lib.unc.edu/

## Conformance

- [conformance/university-of-north-carolina-at-chapel-hill-education-standards-conformance.yml](conformance/university-of-north-carolina-at-chapel-hill-education-standards-conformance.yml) — `shibboleth`, `saml`, `oai-pmh`, `datacite` conformant against the Kin Score `education` regime, plus IIIF (out of regime).

## Notes

- **Re-profiled 2026-08-30 under the API Evangelist university pipeline.** Thirty-six per-tag OpenAPI documents, their pristine `openapi/_original/` source spec, and 84 artifacts derived from them (73 Postman/OpenCollection files, 2 JSON Schema, 2 JSON Structure, 2 examples, 1 JSON-LD context, 1 vocabulary, 2 Spectral rulesets, 1 agentic-access) were removed — 122 files in all. They were the Dataverse product's own contract — `info.title: "Dataverse API"`, `info.description: "Open source research data repository software."` — split by tag, and the same normalized titles are shipped by eight other institutions in this catalog. The deployment is real and is kept as a tenant surface; the product's spec is not credited to UNC.
- **Correction:** an earlier profile described `dc.lib.unc.edu` as running box-c. It does not — that host serves OCLC CONTENTdm 6.10. box-c is genuinely UNC Libraries' own software, and it runs the Carolina Digital Repository at `dcr.lib.unc.edu`, which is now recorded as UNC's strongest institution-operated API.
- The Facilities SPOTS REST API documentation is Onyen-gated and not publicly accessible.
- No single unified public developer portal, API gateway, API terms of service or first-party OpenAPI was found. `api.unc.edu` and `data.unc.edu` do not resolve. No endpoints were fabricated.
